# ES5 Angular Skeleton Overview
----

## What is it about?

The skeletal **app structure** and the **gulp framework** in this repository give a brief introduction on **how to structure** and configure your angular project (along with some sample modules and components) for any of the **Volkswagen NGW page** builds, that you might work on in the future.

The main **purpose** of this skeleton is to **keep the outer structure** of all the builds, the **same**, across multiple projects including the ones that might be worked on by freelancers. This ensures that the built modules and **components can** easily **be made re-usable**, if required, for a different project that might currently be in the pipeline. It also enables **easier on boarding** for any of the in-house developers, who might be assigned to the project at a later point in time.

## How to use the skeleton?

**Fork the skeleton** in this repository and use it as a starting point for your project. Apart from changing the outer skeletal structure and the gulp framework, you are **free to experiment** with, and improve upon the existing set of modules and components or build your own (provided the Volkswagen **guidelines are maintained**).

If you happen to come across any **issues** or want to **suggest improvements**, raise it in the repository containing the original skeleton or create a new feature from develop, for the fix / improvement and issue a pull request back into develop for **review**, once it is complete.

## Why use ES5? Why not ES8?
